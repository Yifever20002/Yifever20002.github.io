I'm currently a master student at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology (IST), The University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. Yinqiang Zheng.

I work on computer vision and computer graphics, with a particular focus on 3D vision. My research interests primarily involve 3D reconstruction, neural rendering, and human avatars. 

My hobbies include playing the violin, watching anime, and gaming.

**Feel free to reach me!**
